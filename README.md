# E-commerce project

## Build with Python / Django / DRF on backend side and with JavaScript / React on the frontend side

## ***Backend***

Run the commands in the main directory

When you list the directories, you have to see the "backend" and "frontend" directories

I use the terminal in Vscode to run the commands

Install virtualenv with pip (pip required)

`pip install virtualenv`

Create new virtualenv

`virtualenv venv`

Activate venv

MacOS or Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`

Windows:

`.\venv\Scripts\activate`

Install backend dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Go to backend directory

`cd backend`

Prepare database (if it's not working, check if you see the manage.py file in the current directory)
```
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate
```

Create admin (answer the questions and bypass the password with 'yes' if you give weak or problematic password)

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

Run backend server

`python manage.py runserver`

Visit the page 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' to check if the backend server is running

You should see a 'Page not found (404)' error, that is good

Go to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/' and log in with your superuser credentials

If you can log in, then your backend is working. 


## ***Frontend***

Vscode -> open a new terminal tab

Go to frontend directory

`cd frontend`

Install frontend dependencies (if it's not working, check if you see the manage.py file in the current directory)

`npm install`

Run frontend server

`npm start`

Visit the page 'http://localhost:3000/' to check if the frontend server is running

#### If you reached this point without any problem, then both front- and backend server is up and running.
### Well done.
